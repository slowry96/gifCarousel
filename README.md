**About!**

🎞

A simple bootstrap carousel page built
using 11ty! 

Was curious to test out 11ty
after reading about it on DEV.to and gave
it a try with a simple bootstrap page.

**Running Locally**

  1. Clone repo to own machine.
  2. Run from command line: `npm install -g @11ty/eleventy`
  3. Inside Repo directory run: `eleventy --serve`
  4. Site will now be running at localhost:8080
  
**Adding Gifs**

To add more gifs, go to giphy.com and copy the end of
the link. It looks like this: `RgzacAyaTfiun7dbFo`

Take that link and add it to the embeds array on the 
Front Matter in index.liquid.

**Also**

Check out 11ty. It's really cool. 😎
